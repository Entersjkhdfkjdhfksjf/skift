> **‚ö† Warning**<br> skiftOS is currently in the early stages of development and is not yet ready for daily use. Please do not use it in production environments. Here be dragons! üêâ

**SkiftOS** is a hobbyist operating system built from the ground up with a focus on modularity, simplicity, and modern design principles.  Driven by a dissatisfaction with the fragmented user experiences prevalent in contemporary operating systems, SkiftOS strives for deep integration and a cohesive aesthetic. This project is a labor of love‚Äîan artistic pursuit rather than a commercial product.
